# You've found my website!

This repository hosts my [personal academic website](https://gerrymcquade.github.io/) :student:. Initially this was made with [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), using the [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [postcards](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) packages, and deployed using Github pages. This was however a little clunky, and in the interest of  keeping an academic website as easy to maintain as possible, I decide to relaunch using the more flexible and straightforward [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) system! :sweat_smile: 

In addition to providing a place to find my CV, social links, and research, I plan to host some write ups of some projects, or to present solutions to coding problems I have faced --- if for no one else then at least for my own future reference! 

In creating this website, I benefited greatly from this short [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9qCS8ODs4o&list=PLkrJrLs7xfbXcEKhTCKRSr2VXH4yiBeXo&pp=iAQB) by Joshua French, as well from following the ["Creating a Website"](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) section of the `quarto` guide.

Finally, if you are interested in how I created and maintain my CV using `Rmarkdown` and the `{stevetemplates}` package, check out my [CV repository](https://github.com/gerrymcquade/cv).
