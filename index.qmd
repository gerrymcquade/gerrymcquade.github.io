I am the Quantitative Research Officer for The Young Lives Research Hub on Climate Change and Environmental Shocks, based at the Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford. I am also a PhD candidate in economics at [Lancaster University Management School](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/gerald-mcquade), with an expected end date of March 2025. My advisers are [Catherine Porter](https://sites.google.com/site/econcath/home) and [Saurabh Singhal](https://sites.google.com/site/singhalecon/Home).

My research interests are in early childhood development and skill formation, the socio-economic impacts of climate and environmental shocks, and the interaction between these two processes in low and middle income contexts. I am also interested in the role of social protection programmes in mitigating the long-term effects of early life shock exposure, as well as investigating interactions with ongoing armed conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic.

I have extensive teaching experience, including working as a Teaching Associate at Lancaster University, and have held visiting Researcher positions at GRADE in Lima, Peru ([Profile](https://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/gerald-mcquade/)) and at The Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford. Prior to beginning my PhD I worked in the public sector as a Statistical Officer with the UK Office for National Statistics and as a Research Intern at the University of Aberdeen.
