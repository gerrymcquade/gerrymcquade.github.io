PhD candidate in economics at [Lancaster University Management School](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/gerald-mcquade). My advisors are [Catherine Porter](https://sites.google.com/site/econcath/home) and [Saurabh Singhal](https://sites.google.com/site/singhalecon/Home).

My research interests are in early childhood development and skill formation, the socio-economic impacts of climate and environmental shocks, and the interaction between these two processes in low and middle income contexts.

I am currently a visiting student with Young Lives at the University of Oxford, hosted by [Marta Favara](https://sites.google.com/site/martafavara/). In winter 2023 I will be a visiting researcher with Grupo De An√°lisis para el Desarrollo, in Lima, Peru.
