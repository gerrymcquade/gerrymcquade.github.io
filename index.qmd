Teaching Associate and PhD candidate in economics at [Lancaster University Management School](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/gerald-mcquade). My advisors are [Catherine Porter](https://sites.google.com/site/econcath/home) and [Saurabh Singhal](https://sites.google.com/site/singhalecon/Home).

My research interests are in early childhood development and skill formation, the socio-economic impacts of climate and environmental shocks, and the interaction between these two processes in low and middle income contexts.

I was recently a visiting researcher with Grupo De An√°lisis para el Desarrollo, in Lima, Peru (see my [profile here](https://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/gerald-mcquade/)). Previously, I was a visiting researcher with Young Lives at the University of Oxford during Trinity & Summer Term 2023, hosted by [Marta Favara](https://sites.google.com/site/martafavara/).

I will be on the job market in 2024-2025. You can view [my CV here](https://gerrymcquade.github.io/cv/GM_cv.pdf).
