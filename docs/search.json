    "section": "",
    "text": "My favourite thing to do in Stata, and the thing I probably spend the most time playing around with is producing tables using Ben Jann’s esttab. While it is a fantastic package that allows you to create almost any publication-ready table output you could think of, how exactly you can create that specific table is not always clear.\nOne example that is not particularly straightforward, yet seems rather common in publications, is a table with multiple panels. For example, if you are running regressions on the same few dependent variables, but for different groups or samples, then it is convenient to display these results in the same table, with a separate panel for each group (e.g. Panel A: Urban, Panel B: Rural, etc.). While the online help files provide many great examples, there isn’t one for this purpose, and although I am not the first to write up an example online (See this Github repository from Luiza Andrade), I wanted to write this up as a reference for myself and hopefully anyone else who stumbles across it!\nIf you are interested in other stuff to do with esttab, why not look at the wrapper package sideytab which I wrote to make it easier to produce “flipped” esttab tables, where the dependent variable/model name is displayed in each row, with each independent variable as a different column. See the Github repository here which includes an online helpfile with examples.\nWhile esttab and its companion commands estadd, estpost, eststo and estout have many great features, not everything is possible just using Stata syntax. However it is possible to extend the functionality of esttab using some simple LaTeX script. I will explain these below in turn. The table we will produce will have 3 panels, but this can be extended to an arbitrary number by repeating the code for the second panel. The output looks like this:\nand the code in full:\n**# REGRESSIONS\n***************\n\n//---PANEL A: ALL CARS---//\neststo priceA: reg price weight\neststo mpgA: reg mpg weight\n\n//---PANEL B: DOMESTIC CARS---//\neststo priceB: reg price weight if foreign == 0\neststo mpgB: reg mpg weight if foreign == 0\n\n//---PANEL C: FOREIGN ONLY---//\neststo priceC: reg price weight if foreign == 1\neststo mpgC: reg mpg weight if foreign == 1\n\n**# ESTOUT\n**********\n//general options - same in every panel\nlocal gops      b(2) se(2) noconstant ///\n                starlevel(* 0.10 ** 0.05 *** 0.01) staraux ///\n                fragment booktabs\n\n//---PANEL A---//\n//Latex code - different for each panel\nlocal preheadA  \"\\begin{tabular}{l*{@M}{c}} \\hline\" //only need in first panel\nlocal postheadA \"\\hline \\multicolumn{@span}{l}{\\textbf{Panel A: All Cars}} \\\\\"\n\nesttab          priceA mpgA ///\n                using \"output/multi_panel.tex\", replace ///\n                `gops' ///\n                mtitle(\"Price\" \"MPG\") ///\n                prehead(`preheadA') posthead(`postheadA')\n\n//---PANEL B---//\n//Latex code\nlocal postheadB \"\\hline \\multicolumn{@span}{l}{\\textbf{Panel B: Domestic Only}} \\\\\"\n\nesttab          priceB mpgB ///\n                using \"output/multi_panel.tex\", append ///\n                `gops' ///\n                nonumber nomtitle ///\n                posthead(`postheadB')\n\n//---PANEL C---//\n//Latex code\nloc postheadC   \"\\hline \\multicolumn{@span}{l}{\\textbf{Panel C: Foreign}} \\\\\"               \nlocal postfootC \"\\hline \\end{tabular}\"\n\nesttab          priceC mpgC ///\n                using \"output/multi_panel.tex\", append ///\n                `gops' ///\n                nonumber nomtitle ///\n                posthead(`postheadC') postfoot(`postfootC')"

    "text": "Global options\nLets breakdown the key components here, starting with the local 'gops' which contains all the options which remain the same across all panels. Most important are the options fragment which tells esttab to suppress the LaTeX opening and closing code it usually includes in .tex output, and booktabs which tells esttab to output the table in a format recognised by the \\booktabs{} package.\nAnother thing to notice is that while in the first call of esttab we tell it to replace/overwrite the file output/multi_panel.tex, subsequent calls use append to add the newly generated table content to the same file. This is important, otherwise you won’t end up with a complete LaTeX table.\nNext we look at the LaTeX code that is specific to each panel."

    "text": "Panel A (the first panel)\nThis is the first panel of the table, and is the first thing esttab writes to a new file. As we tell esttab to suppress the opening and closing material for the table, we need to add this manually. We do so through the prehead() option. We specify:\n\n\"\\begin{tabular}{l*{@M}{c}} \\hline\"\n\nWhich begins the tabular environment, the default LaTeX method to create tables. We specify the parameter {l*{@M}{c}}, where @M is an esttab substitution function which is replaced by the number of models in our table (here 2 models, priceA and mpgA). This is a macro which is expanded to give a table with centered ({c}) columns equal to the number of models (l*{2}). finally we draw a horizontal line at the top of the table with \\hline (\\toprule can also be used). For this panel, we want to display the headings for each column, which relate to the model title. We do this using the mtitle() option.\nNext is the panel title “Panel A: All Cars” which comes immediately after the headings. It is specified using the aptly-named posthead() option, for which we enter:\n\n\"\\hline \\multicolumn{@span}{l}{\\textbf{Panel A: All Cars}} \\\\\"\n\nThe command \\multicolumn{} tells LaTeX the bolded text “Panel A: All Cars” spans across multiple columns, with the option [l] telling it that it should be left aligned (or [c], [r]). The first set of curled brackets tells it how many columns to span, with @span being another esttab substitution function which provides the total number of columns for the table. Finally \\\\ takes a new line before pasting in the rest of the table."

The main change in terms of LaTeX code is that we change the text to be displayed to be as the panel title through the posthead() option:\n\n\"\\hline \\multicolumn{@span}{l}{\\textbf{Panel B: Domestic Only}} \\\\\"\n\nWhich prints a horizontal line followed by a left-aligned Panel B: Domestic Only between the previous panel and this panel’s content. Finally, remember to use the append option or else esttab will overwrite your 1st panel in the output!"
